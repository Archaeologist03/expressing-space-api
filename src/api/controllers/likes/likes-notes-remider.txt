- Thinking of going with bare bones for each category - ex. Artist only have name, song only name of song and author, etc..
- That way we can save space in DB, and also not displaying all the info, that isnt necessary on client.
- Also easier to fetch data for each user, and to match users.
- Got two options:
  1. Bare bones likes and just like so far, each added "like" has its user in users array.
  2. User have array with all likes(songs, books..etc) arrays, array for each like, so we can get all of his likes like that.

- In both ways we would have to update both likes and user collections, on deletes, adds..
- Problem might occure on updating. Since we dont want to change it for everyone. So solution might be to create new "like" on update, if there is no that "like" already in DB.


!!! === Decision === !!!
- 2. option, likes IDs going into users array with all likes IDs.
- And for now we are going to skip edit.
